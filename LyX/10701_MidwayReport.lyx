% The \author macro works with any number of authors. There are two
% commands used to separate the names and addresses of multiple
% authors: \And and \AND.
%
% Using \And between authors leaves it to LaTeX to determine where to
% break the lines. Using \AND forces a line break at that point. So,
% if LaTeX puts 3 of 4 authors names on the first line, and the last
% on the second line, try using \AND instead of \And before the third
% author name.

\begin_layout Abstract
Our project aims to better understand online reviewer arrival and rating
 activity through generative graphical models.
 These models posit rules and distributional assumptions over latent variables
 underlying agent activity.
 Past research has utilized model likelihood to compare such models, and
 we will explore extensions to this approach.
 We will focus on reviews of Apple App Store mobile phone applications,
 and, if time allows, other contexts in which our approach is applicable.

Project Outline
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The modeling of social network graph formation has been roughly split into
 "macroscopic" and "microscopic" approaches, the former of which aims to
 replicate observed global properties of the network, while the latter aims
 to specify plausible rules regarding node and edge formation [1].
 We wish to study microscopic models and subsequently design a satisfactory
 model for describing online reviewing activity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Modeling Reviewer Entry and Behavior
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our main goal will be to arrive at a satisfactory set of rules, distributional
 assumptions, and relationships between latent and observed parameters regarding
 online reviewing activity.
 Past "microscopic" research has taken this approach, but our context differs
 in unique ways.
 For one, the particular relationships we've decided to focus on (reviews)
 are mostly uni-directional (reviewers-to-apps).
 Also, reviewing activity itself is sufficiently distinct from social interactio
n to warrant different rules and parameters regarding edge formation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Data
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using web-scraping tools, we've created a dataset of mobile phone application
 reviews from the Apple App Store.
 Each row in our dataset contains a timestamped individual user review,
 including their username, the name of the app they've used, the particular
 rating they gave the app, and the text of their review.
 Reviews in the dataset extend to 2012, encompassing all apps we were able
 to find publicly.
 This excludes any private "B2B" enterprise apps which are utilized internally
 by corporations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Evaluation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We will explore extensions to the likelihood-comparison approach for microscopic
 graphical models [1].
 Although past researchers have argued that models with higher likelihood
 are "better" or better-suited for describing a social network, we would
 like to be more rigorous and precise about how this likelihood-comparison
 among models is made.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Division of Work
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We plan to jointly brainstorm new iterations of our graphical models and
 extensions to likelihood-comparison evaluation.
 The actual implementation of iterations will be distributed among us, according
 to our strengths.
 We plan to use Python and R for our coding, analysis, estimation, and evaluatio
n tasks.
 Both of us are proficient with both tools, so we will assign smaller tasks
 in roughly even workloads.
 For now, a tentative split of labor could be that Christian focuses on
 building the codebase for the graph formation rules, while Meghanath focuses
 on writing code for the likelihood-comparison evaluation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Timeline
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By the midterm report, we hope to have established a satisfactory pipeline
 for evaluating model iterations, such that we can implement and test distributi
onal choices and rules efficiently.
 The baseline for doing this is a mere comparison of model likelihood [1].
 By the end of the semester, we hope to extend this evaluation approach
 and, as an application, arrive at a satisfactory model of online review
 activity.

\begin_layout Section
Generative Model of ITunes App Reviews
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We now describe our initial attempt at a network evolution model of ITunes
 App Store review activity.
 Our model extends on prior work on microscopic graph constructors by considerin
g two distinct classes of nodes, app and users, which form a bipartite graph.
 Furthermore, we consider the role of app genres and users' affiinity for
 specific genres (e.g.
 games, productivity, lifestyle) in the creation of edges beween them.
 Doing so allows us to capture latent 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

personality
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 types, which we also consider modeling via a mixture mode or LCA.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is important to note that each edge in our graph corresponds to a user
 review of an app, and thus edges are only created by user nodes to app
 nodes.
 App nodes sample finite lifetimes, which captures their tendency to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

trend
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, while users sample the total number of reviews they will emit.
 Our initial model is as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
1.
 App nodes are generated according to the app-generation function 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{A}(t)$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
2.
 Apps sample a genre 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 from an empirical histogram 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{g,app}$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
3.
 Apps sample a lifetime 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 from a fitted exponential function 
\begin_inset Formula $exp(\lambda)$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
4.
 User nodes are generated according to a user-generation function 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{U}(t)$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
5.
 Users sample a genre 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 from an empirical histogram 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{g,user}$
\end_inset

 and a lifetime (number of reviews) 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{u}$
\end_inset

 from a histogram 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{n,user}$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
6.
 Users create their first edge according proportional to the degree of the
 (active) nodes within the genre (Preferential Attachment)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
7.
 At subsequent time steps, users first sample a next genre 
\begin_inset Formula $k'$
\end_inset

 according to a 1-MM process of transitions between genres.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
8.
 Then, users create an edge to an app in the new genre according to PA,
 provided they have not reached their limit on edges created 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{u}$
\end_inset

 .
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This first iteration of our model relies largely on sampling from histograms
 computed from the data.
 As such, we'd expect most macroscopic properties to mirror those of the
 data, with one important exception: the resulting edge structure, which
 we assume to be constructed by Preferential Attachment behavior (within
 genre).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Simulation Results
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We simulate our model on a weekly basis, across 200 weeks of data.
 We see that the expected macroscopic properties are indeed replicated,
 but we also see that the resulting edge distribution, for which we imposed
 a particular external generative assumption, also roughly matches the edge
 distribution of the data.
